# rubix-scripts

This repository contains two sets of scripts to facilitate the setup of a Rubix Testnet environment. Choose the appropriate script based on your requirements:

1. **[Rubix Non-Quorum Scripts](https://github.com/rubixchain/rubix-scripts/tree/main/rubix-non-quorum-scripts)**  
   This script sets up a single non-quorum Rubix node on your machine. It handles the installation of all necessary dependencies and ensures the node runs in the background upon successful execution. After setup, you can explore and test Rubix APIs seamlessly.

2. **[Rubix Testnet Scripts](https://github.com/rubixchain/rubix-scripts/tree/main/rubix-testnet-scripts)**  
   This script sets up a complete Rubix Testnet on your machine, including all required validator nodes. It is designed to provide a full-featured Rubix testnet environment for testing and development purposes.
